# CodeAlpha_Task3_Resume_Builder
This #project utilized various front-end #development tools such as #HTML, #css , and #JavaScript to build an #interactive and #responsive web application.

To start with, I used HTML to #structure the #pages of the Resume Builder. HTML provided the #foundation for creating different sections and elements, such as #input fields for #users to fill in their resume #information.

Next, I employed CSS to enhance the design of the #application. By applying CSS #styles, I made the #resume form visually appealing, ensuring that it was easy to navigate and interact with. CSS allowed me to #customize the fonts, colors, #layouts , and other visual aspects of the application.

To make the Resume Builder more #dynamic and #userfriendly , I utilized JavaScript. With JavaScript, I implemented #functionality that dynamically displayed the fields users needed to fill in for their resumes. This interactive #approach provided a seamless user #experience, #guiding them through the resume creation process.

An #essential #feature of the application was the "Generate CV" #button, which triggered an #onclick event. Upon clicking this button, the values entered by the user in the input fields were #captured and placed into a resume #templates . This template, customized based on the user's inputs, was then displayed on the #page

Finally, I #added a "Print" button, enabling users to #print and #save their resumes in a user-friendly #format. This feature allowed them to obtain a physical or #digital copy of their resume effortlessly.
